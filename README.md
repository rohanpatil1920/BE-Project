Recognizing informative tweetscould be a difficult errand during the fiasco from such an enormous pool of tweets.As asolution to the current issue of sorting out enlightening tweets, we present a techniqueto perceive the distinguishing calamity related informative tweets from the Twitterstreams utilizing the textual content.Our objective is to construct a model by usingNatural Language Processing(NLP),Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and SupportVector Machine(SVM) to categorize the textual content for the tweets. In this kernelwell explore classification of tweets as disaster or non-disaster, using TensorFlowand Keras.The output of the text-based model are consolidated using the late fusiontechnique to predict the tweet label.
